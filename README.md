## Data and code showing the efficacy of databases relative to existing mass-spectrometry data formats

This repository pioneers the use of SQL databases for the efficient storage and access of raw
mass-spectrometry (MS) data.
Existing data formats fail to provide intuitive, rapid, and programmatic search of raw MS data and require learning
the quirks and conceits of idiosyncratic file formats. Databases have
consistent and transferrable syntax for queries, 
benefit from multi-file aggregations of data, 
and are established as an industry standard.

### Consistent and transferrable syntax

### Benefit from multi-file data aggregations

### Established as an industry standard

## Goals

1. Determine when and how databases offer a performance improvement over existing MS file types
2. Explore multiple database types and provide use-case recommendations for each
3. Provide code that allows for the elegant conversion of existing MS data into database
