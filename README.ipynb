    "## Data and code demonstrating the efficacy of databases relative to existing mass-spectrometry data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository implements \"vanilla\" SQL databases for the efficient storage and access of raw mass-spectrometry (MS) data. Here, \"raw\" MS data refers to the data encoded in vendor or .mzML files and contains coordinates of retention time, *m/z* ratio, and intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing data formats fail to provide intuitive, rapid, and programmatic search of raw MS data and require learning\n",
    "the quirks and conceits of idiosyncratic file formats. Databases have\n",
    "consistent and transferrable syntax for queries, indexing and binary search for rapid data extraction,\n",
    "benefit from multi-file aggregations of data, can store processed data alongside, and are established as an industry standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple efforts have revealed where SQL is acknowledged as an excellent solution for MS data, including\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Metabolomics Workbench\n",
    "  2. MassQL development\n",
    "  3. Spectra package backends\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistent and transferrable syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is widely known and understood. Transforming MS data into a format that can be queried using SQL allows\n",
    "developers to focus on building downstream products instead of comprehending the particulars of a given\n",
    "file type. SQL also often results in queries much closer to natural language - compare \n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT * FROM MS1 WHERE rt BETWEEN 5 AND 6```\n",
    "\n",
    "to\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "from pyteomics import mzml\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",

    "        if spectrum['ms level'] == 1:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and binary search for rapid data extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases can be highly optimized for the extraction of data subsets. For MS data, this means that\n",
    "it's just as easy to find a single scan as it is to extract an entire chromatogram. Many existing\n",
    "data formats have indexes built in that identify the start or end byte of a given scan, but still\n",
    "require every scan to be extracted when the information *within* the scan is of interest (as when\n",
    "subsetting by *m/z* or intensity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefit from multi-file data aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing MS data formats preserve the idea of \"one sample = one file\". With databases, the filename or\n",
    "identifier can be simply encoded as an additional column and the entire dataset can be concatenated\n",
    "together, allowing for rapid searches across every file simultaneously. Without this, MS datasets\n",
    "increase linearly in time with the number of files in the dataset as each file is looped over\n",
    "one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can store processed data alongside\n",
    "\n",
    "After chromatographic peakpicking or compound identification has been performed, the resulting\n",
    "peak list (start_rt, end_rt, mean_mz, area, etc.) can be stored as an additional table in the\n",
    "database. Not only does this make it easy to share all the data (often a single .sql file or \n",
    "database connection instead of multiple mzMLs and CSVs), but it also allows for powerful\n",
    "join operations between the raw and processed data that enable rapid extraction of the\n",
    "individual data points that compose a chromatographic peak. Additionally, metadata or corrected\n",
    "retention times similarly benefit from simple and powerful joins that minimize memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Established as an industry standard\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases are being actively developed by corporations much larger than any mass-spectrometry lab. This\n",
    "means that the improvements in access speed and compression efficiency can be passed along to the MS\n",
    "data within them without any extra effort. Additionally, databases are supported by an enormous community\n",
    "of experts rather than individual developers who may leave the project and result in a deprecated file type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine when and how databases offer a performance improvement over existing MS file types\n",
    "2. Explore multiple database types and provide use-case recommendations for each\n",
    "3. Provide code that allows for the elegant conversion of existing MS data into database\n",

After following the instructions on the Github for installation and compilation with Apache Maven, I'm able to access msViz (`java -jar MZTree/msDataServer/msDataServer-1.0.jar`) and convert mzMLs to mzTree files (and the mzTree-points extra) but can't figure out how to query the server. Running `ifconfig` in WSL (where I installed msViz) gave me the IP address to use (172.27.178.175) which, combined with the port number specified in the application let me open a client with Chrome. I then tried to guess at the parameters but got a 500 internal server error with `http://172.27.178.175:4567/api/v2/getpoints?mzmin=118.08&mzmax=118.10&rtmin=0&rtmax=100`.
