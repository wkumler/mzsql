  abstract = {The evolution of data exchange in Mass Spectrometry spans decades and has ranged from human-readable text files representing individual scans or collections thereof (McDonald et al., 2004) through the official standard XML-based (Harold, Means, \& Udemadu, 2005) data interchange standard (Deutsch, 2012), to increasingly compressed (Teleman et al., 2014) variants of this standard sometimes requiring purely binary adjunct files (R{\"o}mpp et al., 2011). While the desire to maintain even partial human readability is understandable, the inherent mismatch between XML's textual and irregular format relative to the numeric and highly regular nature of actual spectral data, along with the explosive growth in dataset scales and the resulting need for efficient (binary and indexed) access has led to a phenomenon referred to as ``technical drift'' (Davis, 2013). While the drift is being continuously corrected using adjunct formats, compression schemes, and programs (R{\"o}st et al., 2015), we propose that the future of Mass Spectrometry Exchange Formats lies in the continued reliance and development of the PSI-MS (Mayer et al., 2014) controlled vocabulary, along with an expedited shift to an alternative, thriving and well-supported ecosystem for scientific data-exchange, storage, and access in binary form, namely that of HDF5 (Koranne, 2011). Indeed, pioneering efforts to leverage this universal, binary, and hierarchical data-format have already been published (Wilhelm et al., 2012; R{\"u}bel et al., 2013) though they have under-utilized self-description, a key property shared by HDF5 and XML. We demonstrate that a straightforward usage of plain (``vanilla'') HDF5 yields immediate returns including, but not limited to, highly efficient data access, platform independent data viewers, a variety of libraries (Collette, 2014) for data retrieval and manipulation in many programming languages and remote data access through comprehensive RESTful data-servers. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.                            Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on               n               -ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

The ability to interrogate these rich datasets is handicapped by the limited capability and flexibility of existing software. We introduce the Mass Spec Query Language (MassQL) that addresses these issues by enabling an expressive set of mass spectrometry patterns to be queried directly from raw data. MassQL is an open-source mass spectrometry query language for flexible and mass spectrometer manufacturer-independent mining of MS data. We envision the flexibility, scalability, and ease of use of MassQL will empower the mass spectrometry community to take fuller advantage of their mass spectrometry data and accelerate discoveries.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               With the precision of the mass spectrometry (MS) going higher, the MS file size increases rapidly. Beyond the widely-used open format mzML, near-lossless or lossless compression algorithms and formats emerged in scenarios with different precision requirements. The data precision is often related to the instrument and subsequent processing algorithms. Unlike storage-oriented formats, which focus more on lossless compression rate, computation-oriented formats concentrate as much on decoding speed as the compression rate.                                         Results                                Here we introduce ``Aird'', an opensource and computation-oriented format with controllable precision, flexible indexing strategies, and high compression rate. Aird provides a novel compressor called Zlib-Diff-PforDelta (ZDPD) for m/z data. Compared with Zlib only, m/z data size is about 55\% lower in Aird average. With the high-speed decoding and encoding performance of the single instruction multiple data technology used in the ZDPD, Aird merely takes 33\% decoding time compared with Zlib. We have downloaded seven datasets from ProteomeXchange and Metabolights. They are from different SCIEX, Thermo, and Agilent instruments. Then we convert the raw data into mzML, mgf, and mz5 file formats by MSConvert and compare them with Aird format. Aird uses JavaScript Object Notation for metadata storage. Aird-SDK is written in Java, and AirdPro is a GUI client for vendor file converting written in C\#. They are freely available at                 https://github.com/CSi-Studio/Aird-SDK                 and                 https://github.com/CSi-Studio/AirdPro                 .                                                        Conclusions               With the innovation of MS acquisition mode, MS data characteristics are also constantly changing. New data features can bring more effective compression methods and new index modes to achieve high search performance. The MS data storage mode will also become professional and customized. ZDPD uses multiple MS digital features, and researchers also can use it in other formats like mzML. Aird is designed to become a computing-oriented data format with high scalability, compression rate, and fast decoding speed.},

LC-MS instrumentation and analysis conditions can differ substantially among laboratories and experiments, thus resulting in non-standardized datasets demanding customized annotation workflows. We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered around the MetaboCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation and CompoundDb packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation can be performed based on MS1 properties such as m/z and retention times, followed by an MS2-based annotation in which experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference library. Such reference databases can be created and managed with the CompoundDb package. The ecosystem supports data from a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, MSP, MGF, mzML, mzXML, netCDF as well as MassBank text files and SQL databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted LC-MS-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly unit-tested and documented and are available on GitHub and through Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The closed nature of vendor file formats in mass spectrometry is a significant barrier to progress in developing robust bioinformatics software. In response, the community has developed the open mzML format, implemented in XML and based on controlled vocabularies. Widely adopted, mzML is an important step forward; however, it suffers from two challenges that are particularly apparent as the field moves to high-throughput proteomics: large increase in file size, and a largely sequential I/O access pattern. Described here is `toffee', an open, random I/O format backed by HDF5, with lossless compression that gives file sizes similar~to the original vendor format and can be reconverted back to mzML without penalty. It is shown that mzML and toffee are equivalent when processing data using OpenSWATH algorithms, in additional to novel applications that are enabled by new data access patterns. For instance, a peptide-centric deep-learning pipeline for peptide identification is proposed. Documentation and examples are available at               https://toffee.readthedocs.io               , and all code is MIT licensed at               https://bitbucket.org/cmriprocan/toffee               .},

This asks to retrieve from an MS dataset some selected peaks in a data window whose image in a display window reflects the visual feature of all peaks in the data window. If an algorithm for this purpose is asked to output high-quality solutions in real time, then the most fundamental dependence of it is on the storage format of the MS dataset.                                         Results               We present mzMD, a new storage format of MS datasets and an algorithm to query this format of a storage system for a summary (a set of selected representative peaks) of a given data window. We propose a criterion Q-score to examine the quality of data window summaries. Experimental statistics on real MS datasets verified the high speed of mzMD in retrieving high-quality data window summaries. mzMD reported summaries of data windows whose Q-score outperforms those mzTree reported. The query speed of mzMD is the same as that of mzTree whereas its query speed stability is better than that of mzTree.
